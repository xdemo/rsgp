Far from finished, do not complain. Things will be broken.

One important note is the icons intended to be part of this project.
They are officially trademarks of Jagex Ltd. And am working to  resolve
a way to do this. Whether asking for permission, or simply recreating
custom ones which match the approriate skill icon.

For now you can manually download them from the runescape website
and place in the same directory as the scripts. As long as you
don't rename them they should load up nicely.

Depends on, glade-perl libglade perl-gtk2-mozembed
And obviously openjdk / sun-java (otherwise you wouldn't be able to run 
runescape in the first place.

To launch the runescape client: 
	
	$ perl rsgp.pl
