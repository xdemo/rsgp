rsgp - runescape client for linux/bsd [version - ???]



Far from finished, do not complain. Things will be broken.

Current Features:
	Highscores lookup tab pane
	Game Window

Support for fetching icons from the web, "File > fetch icons"
xterm will pop-up and wget them into the script directory.
Reload the client for changes to take effect.

Depends on, glade-perl libglade perl-gtk2-mozembed
And obviously openjdk / sun-java (otherwise you wouldn't be able to run 
runescape in the first place.

To launch the runescape client: 
	
	$ perl rsgp.pl
